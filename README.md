🚗 Moving Element Detector with GUI 👀

📝 Introduction

Detecting moving objects in video streams is a critical task in modern computer vision applications. From traffic monitoring 🚦 and security surveillance 🛡️ to robotics navigation 🤖 and sports analysis 🏀, motion detection helps automate monitoring and decision-making processes.

The Moving Element Detector with GUI is a Python-based application designed to detect and highlight moving objects in video files. Using OpenCV 🖼️, it processes each frame to detect motion, while Tkinter 🖥️ provides an interactive GUI for selecting videos, starting detection, and stopping it. This project allows users to visualize motion in real-time ⏱️ with green bounding boxes 🟩 around moving elements, providing an intuitive and practical tool for learning and experimentation in computer vision.

📌 Project Overview

This Python project detects moving elements in video files, such as vehicles 🚗, people 🧍, or other objects 📦, using OpenCV and a Tkinter GUI. It highlights detected motion with green bounding boxes 🟩, making it suitable for surveillance 🛡️, traffic monitoring 🚦, robotics 🤖, and motion analysis 📊.

✨ Key Features

🖥️ User-Friendly GUI: Includes buttons to open videos, start detection, and stop detection.

🚀 Real-Time Motion Detection: Detects moving objects efficiently using OpenCV’s BackgroundSubtractorMOG2.

🟩 Bounding Boxes: Highlights moving objects with green rectangles.

🎥 Supports Multiple Video Formats: Compatible with MP4, AVI, and other formats.

⚡ Lightweight and Easy-to-Use: Designed for beginners and professionals alike.

🛠️ Project Workflow

Video Input 🎥: User selects a video through the GUI.

Background Subtraction 🖼️: OpenCV separates moving objects from the background using MOG2.

Noise Removal ✨: Morphological operations clean small false detections.

Contour Detection 🔍: Detects edges and shapes of moving objects.

Bounding Box Drawing 🟩: Draws green rectangles around detected motion.

Display Output 🖥️: Shows the video with moving elements highlighted in real-time.

GUI Control 🖱️: Users can start or stop detection anytime.
